        <p>
            Hello, my name is Thomas Kambale, and I am a software engineering student at Moringa School. My goal is to use the skills I acquire to secure a job and improve the living conditions at home. <br>
            I believe that software engineering is a field that offers great potential for growth and impact, and I am excited to be part of this dynamic and constantly evolving industry. <br>
            Through my coursework and practical experience, I intend to develop a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and Java, as well as web development frameworks like Flask and Django. <br>
            I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting and contribute to the development of innovative and impactful software solutions. <br>
            I am particularly interested in the areas of web development, machine learning, and data science, and I am committed to continuous learning and development to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. <br>
            Outside of my studies, I enjoy a range of hobbies including swimming, traveling, hiking, and motorcycle riding. <br>
            These activities allow me to recharge and stay energized, and I find that they often inspire me to think creatively and approach problems from new perspectives.
            Thank you for taking the time to read my portfolio. <br>
            I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and expertise to make a meaningful impact. <br>
        </p>

                            Before the commencement of the class, I must complete a preliminary one-week pre-work which involves becoming familiar with our online learning management system (Canvas), configuring their computer environment, and gaining an understanding of the fundamental concepts of programming languages.
                            This pre-work will help them prepare for the first day of the program.</td>

                            By mastering the fundamental components of web rendering, I become proficient in the language that enhances the appearance of web pages.
                            I also acquire the knowledge and skills to create user interfaces for web applications by writing organized and well-crafted HTML and CSS code.

            Thomas is on a journey to acquire knowledge and skills in a range of technologies and programming languages required for developing applications that meet the needs of modern-day businesses. <br>
            This includes learning front-end development using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development with tools like databases, server-side scripting languages such as PHP, and frameworks like Ruby on Rails. <br>
            His goal is to become proficient in every aspect of software development, from designing and building user interfaces to handling data, and to eventually develop dynamic and interactive web applications that can solve real-world problems. <br>
            Along the way, He will encounter challenges and setbacks, but His passion for coding and their desire to build something meaningful will keep Him motivated to push forward and achieve their goals. <br>
